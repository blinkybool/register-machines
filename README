# Register Machines

`rm.luau` simulates [register machines](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~ooste110/syllabi/compthmoeder.pdf) with lua tables.

I think the composition, primitive-recursion, minimisation operations are correct.
But you don't prove things like this in lua. Use lean for that.
These register machines run wild and free with little type constraints.
Batteries and disk space not included.
